====== Saturday 23 Dec 2023 ======

==== Started the whole thing ====

Well, today, I finally decided to do this...

I always wanted to test my skills by doing the whole web development thing perfectly from the start.
I want to try to build the backend in various languages, including Rust, Go and yes, even python.

Databases I would use are Postgres and Redis for Caching

The frontends would be partially in SvelteKit and HTMX.
I am quite excited.

Do follow along the journals if you interested â˜º

They will be posted initially here on Github and then slowly on my [[https://noobscience.vercel.app|website]].

==== The Initial Part Works ====

Well for now, I am mainly focusing on the rust part and I was able to set up sqlx and sea-query. 
So my program now works with a postgresql database.

Quite excited for what I can do next.
