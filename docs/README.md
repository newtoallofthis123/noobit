# Documentation

Noobit is quite an ambitious project of mine that I want to build from the start.
However, I want to be careful.

I already tried building the backend once and failed terribly.
The code was just not *it* if you know what I mean.

So I have decided to first make a good **plan** which I now realize is *crucial* to a good project.
Here we go.

## Main Backend

I want the main backend to be written using Golang. I had initially planned on using Rust, but I mean
Go is Go. It is just for me.

## Caching

The caching and new users layer will be handled by a rust backend powered by an Axum server.
